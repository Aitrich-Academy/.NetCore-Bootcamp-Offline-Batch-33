        Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to simulate human intelligence, allowing them to <br>
         perform tasks like learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI systems use algorithms and data to <br>
          recognize patterns, understand language, and complete tasks without explicit instructions for every step.  <br>
          It is used in many applications, from virtual assistants and search engines to medical diagnosis and autonomous vehicles,  <br>
          and can help automate processes and improve accuracy.

            Artificial intelligence isn’t just coming for the factory workers or call centres anymore, it’s starting to reshape the American  <br>
            job market as a whole. A new government-backed report suggests that millions of roles could be swept up in the  <br>
            coming wave of automation, and the group taking the biggest hit might not be who you think. <br>
            It highlights a wide range of at-risk sectors, with everything from customer service and accounting to education and fast food all under threat.
